Key Acquisition History

RBC Capital Markets highlighted that the bank's Q2 results represented a "beat with many moving parts," with actual performance surpassing consensus estimates [162] . Notably, broker consensus had been more conservative than management targets:162 • RBC Capital Markets

RoTE consensus of 9.0% versus Deutsche Bank's target of above 10% and actual delivery of 11.0% [163]163 • RBC Capital Markets

Cost/income ratio consensus of 66.5% versus the bank's target below 65% and actual achievement of 62.3% [163]163 • RBC Capital Markets

Revenue consensus of €31.4 billion versus management guidance of around €32 billion [164]164 • RBC Capital Markets

HSBC's analysis suggests the building blocks for Deutsche Bank's €32 billion revenue target "look credible," citing visibility over hedge reinvestment, Assets under Management levels, and Investment Bank pipeline [165] . However, HSBC maintains some caution regarding the sustainability of recent revenue growth, noting the bank's particular sensitivity to interest rate movements.165 • HSBC Global Investment Research

Metzler Equity Research presents a more cautious perspective , arguing that while the group's profitability has improved, the forecasted ROE of approximately 9% for 2025e-2027e may not cover the bank's cost of equity, which they estimate at 11.1% [166] .166 • Metzler Equity Research

Margin Analysis and Quality Assessment
Deutsche Bank's net interest margin (NIM) performance has shown resilience with gradual improvement. The NIM reached 2.9% in Q2 2025 , up from 2.8% in Q1 2025, though the H1 2025 average of 2.8% remained flat compared to the prior year period [167] . This stability is particularly noteworthy given the challenging interest rate environment and competitive deposit pricing pressures.167 • INTRM

The quality of earnings has significantly improved , with the bank's profit before tax more than doubling to €5.3 billion in H1 2025 from €2.3 billion in the prior year period [168] . Importantly, when excluding non-recurring items such as Postbank litigation provisions, profit before tax increased by 37% year-on-year , demonstrating genuine operational improvement rather than one-time benefits [169] .168 169 • Press Release

Operational leverage has been exceptional , with revenue growth of 6% combined with disciplined cost management producing significant margin expansion. The bank has achieved approximately 90% of its €2.5 billion operational efficiency target , with €2.2 billion in cost efficiencies either delivered or expected from completed measures [77] .77 • Transcript - Earnings Calls

Peer Positioning and Competitive Assessment
Deutsche Bank's capital strength positions it favorably among European peers . The bank's CET1 ratio of 14.2% as of June 2025 provides substantial buffer above regulatory requirements, with approximately 252 basis points above the Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) threshold [170] . Analysis of European banks shows Deutsche Bank maintaining a conservative approach to capital management while still delivering strong returns [171] .170 • ARS 171 • ARS

The bank's risk-adjusted performance appears competitive, with provision for credit losses of €423 million in Q2 2025 representing a moderate decline from Q1 levels of €471 million, though this included increased provisions for US Commercial Real Estate of €227 million versus €98 million in Q1 [172] .172 • RBC Capital Markets

Business Segment Performance Quality
All four business segments delivered double-digit profit growth year-on-year in H1 2025, demonstrating the diversified strength of Deutsche Bank's model [173] :173 • Press Release

Private Bank and Asset Management : Contributing positively to overall group performance [173]173 • Press Release

The Fixed Income and Currencies (FIC) business has shown particular strength, with management indicating performance reaching "at least high single digits" in Q3 2025, ahead of consensus expectations [176] . This contrasts with the Origination & Advisory business, which faced headwinds in Q2 but is expected to recover in the second half [177] .176 177 • ING Wholesale Banking

Deutsche Bank's operating performance demonstrates clear improvement trajectory with strong execution against targets, consistent outperformance of broker expectations, and competitive positioning within European banking.

Capital Structure & Liquidity
Deutsche Bank maintains a robust capital structure with strong liquidity buffers, positioning the institution well above regulatory requirements while enabling significant shareholder distributions. The bank's capital position has strengthened considerably, with the CET1 ratio reaching 14.2% as of June 30, 2025, representing a 40 basis point improvement from 13.8% at year-end 2024 [180] . This improvement was primarily driven by lower risk-weighted assets (RWA), partially offset by a decrease in CET1 capital [181] .180 181 • INTRM

Capital Position and Regulatory Metrics
Deutsche Bank's Tier 1 capital totaled €60.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, consisting of €49.5 billion in CET1 capital and €11.4 billion in Additional Tier 1 capital [182] . The bank's leverage ratio stood at 4.7% at the end of the second quarter 2025, up from 4.6% in the first quarter, reflecting positive impacts from capital generation and foreign exchange rate movements [183] . Based on peer comparison analysis, Deutsche Bank's leverage ratio positions it in the middle range among European banking peers [184] .182 • ARS 183 • INTRM 184 • Keefe Bruyette & Woods

The bank operates with significant buffers above minimum regulatory requirements. Management targets maintaining a 200 basis point buffer above the expected MDA threshold as the bank builds capital and absorbs regulatory changes [185] . The Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) and Minimum Requirement of Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) requirements are met with substantial buffers [186] .185 • ARS 186 • Transcript - Earnings Calls

Liquidity Profile and Funding
Deutsche Bank demonstrates strong liquidity metrics across all key regulatory measures. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) reached 136% at the end of the second quarter 2025, representing a €62 billion surplus above the 100% regulatory minimum [180] . This improved from 134% in the first quarter and compares favorably to 131% at year-end 2024 [187] [188] .180 • INTRM 187 • ARS 188 • ARS

High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) totaled €232 billion as of June 30, 2025, slightly higher than €231 billion at the end of the first quarter [189] . The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) stood at 120% at the end of the second quarter, representing a €107 billion surplus and positioning at the high end of the bank's target range of 115-120% [190] . The stressed Net Liquidity Position increased to €75 billion as of June 30, 2025, compared to €56 billion at year-end 2024, driven by reduced modeled stress outflows and increased stress-compliant wholesale funding deposits [191] .189 190 • INTRM 191 • INTRM

Capital Allocation Policy and Shareholder Returns
Deutsche Bank has implemented a disciplined capital allocation framework targeting a 50% payout ratio of net income attributable to shareholders for 2025 and subsequent years, delivered through a combination of cash dividends and share buybacks [192] . For 2025, the bank announced €2.1 billion in shareholder distributions , including €750 million in share buybacks and €1.3 billion in dividends (€0.68 per share) , representing a 50% increase from €0.45 per share for 2023 [193] .192 193 • ARS

Total shareholder distributions since 2022 have reached €5.4 billion , exceeding the €5 billion goal established in the bank's transformation program launched in 2019 [194] [195] . The bank reaffirms its ambition to exceed the €8 billion capital distribution goal for the 2021-2025 period, to be paid between 2022-2026 [196] . Management maintains flexibility to distribute above the 50% payout ratio when capital is sustainably above the 14% threshold, treating this level as both a target and distribution trigger rather than a strict floor [197] .194 • ARS 195 196 • ARS 197 • Transcript - Earnings Calls

Financial Strength Assessment
Deutsche Bank's capital structure provides substantial financial flexibility with multiple layers of capital buffers. The economic capital adequacy ratio was 198% as of June 30, 2025, compared to 199% at year-end 2024, indicating strong internal risk-adjusted capital coverage [198] . The bank's U.S. subsidiaries, DB USA Corporation and DWS USA Corporation, maintain stress capital buffers of 13.9% and 5.6% respectively under Federal Reserve stress testing, demonstrating resilience under severe hypothetical stress scenarios [199] .198 • INTRM 199 • ARS

Customer deposits totaled €653 billion in the second quarter 2025, providing a stable funding base, though down from €665 billion in the first quarter partly due to foreign exchange headwinds [200] . The bank's solid liquidity and funding profile supports its credit ratings, with S&P noting that the funding and liquidity metrics bolster Deutsche Bank's resilience and support the ratings outlook [201] .200 • INTRM 201 • ARS

Investment Thesis/Debates
Deutsche Bank's investment thesis remains one of the most debated among European banks, with analysts and experts holding sharply divergent views on the bank's transformation progress and future prospects. The ongoing discussions center around whether the bank has truly turned the corner or if structural challenges remain unresolved.

Bull Case Arguments
Transformation Progress and ROTE Achievement

RBC Capital Markets presents a constructive view, noting that Deutsche Bank is "on track to meet our 2025 financial targets" with management achieving around 90% of their EUR 2.5 billion target for operational efficiencies [77] . The bank delivered EUR 2.2 billion in cost efficiencies either delivered or expected from completed measures [77] . RBC analysts believe the bank has significant potential, stating "we expect DBK in its strategic update to present a path to an at least 12% ROTE" with focus on cost and capital optimization [202] .77 • Transcript - Earnings Calls 202 • RBC Capital Market Research

Auerbach Grayson takes an even more optimistic stance, expecting Deutsche Bank to report "a group EBT of around EUR 9.5 bn in FY 2025e" , which would be "the highest figure since 2007" when EBT was EUR 8.7 billion [203] . They note the bank's >10% ROTE target "looked very ambitious two or three years ago, but now it seems to be within reach" [204] .203 204 • Auerbach Grayson

Capital Strength and Distribution Potential

The bank's capital position represents a key bull argument. Deutsche Bank achieved capital efficiencies of EUR 30 billion , already at the high end of the target range for 2025, contributing to a strong CET1 ratio of 14.2% [79] . RBC notes the bank "already applied for a second share buyback in addition to the previously announced EUR 2.1 billion distribution" for the year [205] .79 205 • Transcript - Earnings Calls

European Growth Catalyst

Expert insights suggest management stability under CEO Christian Sewing has been crucial, with one former unit head noting "improved management stability, specifically the CEO" as a key driver [206] . Management expresses confidence about European growth prospects, with expectations of "solid growth in the Corporate Bank and in the Private Bank" over the next three years [207] .206 • Expert Call 207 • Transcript - Earnings Calls

Bear Case Arguments
Persistent Cost Challenges

HSBC Global Investment Research presents a more skeptical view, questioning the sustainability of cost control. They note that "adjusting for these two items, the underlying pace of adjusted expense growth is 5% per annum" , requiring "a far higher level of cost containment than DBK has so far been able to deliver" [208] . HSBC maintains concerns about whether "nonrecurring charges recur" , pointing to EUR 2.8 billion in litigation provisions since 2021 and EUR 1.1 billion in restructuring charges [209] .208 • HSBC Global Investment Research 209 • HSBC Global Investment Research

Autonomous Research takes a more cautious stance with an "Underperform" rating and EUR 20.80 price target [210] . They express skepticism about the bank's ability to sustain performance improvements and maintain distribution commitments.210 • Autonomous Research

Regulatory and Capital Concerns

The implementation of CRR3 and Basel III reforms presents ongoing challenges. While management believes there are "clear pathways to materially reduce or eliminate the hypothetical impact of CRR3" [211] , RBC acknowledges concerns about "headline risk when stress test results are published" [212] . The European stress test results show Deutsche Bank with a CET1 depletion of -477 basis points under adverse scenarios, compared to the European average of -535 basis points [213] .211 • Transcript - Earnings Calls 212 • RBC Capital Market Research 213 • Oddo BHF Corporates & Markets

Market Environment Sensitivity

RBC highlights the bank's vulnerability to market conditions, noting that "given its high gearing to investment banking, our earnings estimates are very sensitive to a change in environment and outlook" [214] . Recent performance has shown this sensitivity, with management dropping targets for "+30% growth in IB fees 2025/24" following slower M&A activity [215] .214 • RBC Capital Market Research 215 • RBC Capital Markets

Key Unanswered Questions and Debates
Sustainability of Performance Metrics

A central debate revolves around whether Deutsche Bank's recent performance improvements represent sustainable transformation or cyclical benefits. HSBC questions whether the bank can maintain its cost discipline, noting that "there is a risk of at least some negative surprises" regarding nonrecurring charges [216] .216 • HSBC Global Investment Research

Technology and AI Investment Returns

Expert commentary suggests uncertainty about technology investments, particularly AI capabilities. While noting "there's a proven case in automation and cost efficiency" , experts acknowledge that "what is less well understood as an industry is how really AI is going to change things" [217] . The partnership with Google to accelerate AI opportunities represents a significant bet on technological transformation.217 • Expert Call

Capital Distribution Sustainability

The debate over capital distribution policy remains contentious. While the bank updated its policy to "distributing additional excess capital above 14%" [218] , analysts question the sustainability given regulatory headwinds and potential economic slowdowns in Germany.218 • RBC Capital Market Research

Litigation and Governance Risks

Ongoing controversies continue to cloud the investment thesis. Current litigation provisions stand at EUR 1.6 billion with contingent liabilities at EUR 0.7 billion as of Q2 2025 [219] . The "ongoing investigation from regulators into 'greenwashing' at DWS, and the handling of customer complaints at Postbank" have exposed risks to internal governance procedures [220] .219 • RBC Capital Market Research 220 • RBC Capital Markets

Stock-Specific Controversies
Valuation Disconnect

A key controversy centers on Deutsche Bank's valuation relative to performance improvements. RBC removed their "Speculative Risk rating, given improved consistency of performance and profitability" and upgraded their price target to EUR 29 [221] . However, this contrasts sharply with Autonomous Research's EUR 20.80 target [222] , highlighting the wide dispersion in analyst views.221 • RBC Capital Market Research 222 • Autonomous Research

European Banking Consolidation Risk

The potential for Deutsche Bank's involvement in European banking consolidation presents both opportunity and risk. RBC notes that "DBK could get involved in European bank consolidation which given DBK's low share price rating might be highly dilutive" [223] .223 • RBC Capital Market Research

The investment thesis for Deutsche Bank ultimately hinges on whether the bank can prove that its recent performance improvements represent genuine structural transformation rather than temporary cyclical benefits, while successfully navigating ongoing regulatory challenges and maintaining capital distribution commitments in an uncertain European economic environment.

Valuation
Deutsche Bank's valuation presents a complex picture, with the stock trading at elevated multiples relative to peers despite concerns about return adequacy. Recent analyst price targets reflect divergent views on the bank's transformation progress and earnings sustainability, with methodologies ranging from traditional price-to-book approaches to sophisticated sum-of-the-parts analyses.

Analyst Price Targets and Methodologies
Current analyst price targets for Deutsche Bank show a wide range, reflecting different perspectives on the bank's valuation and prospects:

RBC Capital Markets maintains an EUR 29.00 price target (upgraded from EUR 25.00), utilizing a growth price-to-book valuation methodology aligned with peer analysis. The firm applies a 12.0% cost of equity , consistent with European banking peers, and values the bank on 2027 estimates [224] . RBC's upside scenario of EUR 39 assumes Deutsche Bank can deliver a 12% ROTE by 2028 with reduced cost of equity to 10% [225] .224 225 • RBC Capital Market Research

Metzler Capital Markets sets a price target of EUR 26.80 using their proprietary ROE/COE model with an estimated cost of equity of 11.1% [226] . Their valuation approach focuses solely on absolute valuation metrics rather than peer comparisons, representing their standard methodology for German banking coverage [227] .226 • Auerbach Grayson 227 • Metzler Capital Markets

HSBC Global Investment Research raised its price target to EUR 19.50 (from EUR 14.30) using a sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) calculation based on 2027 estimates. The 36% target price increase reflects both improved ROTE expectations and the rolling forward of their valuation model [228] .228 • HSBC Global Investment Research

Autonomous Research employs a DCF-based sum-of-parts valuation methodology, deriving a price target of EUR 24.0 with a mid-term return on allocated capital assumption of 10.5% and cost of equity of 12.1% [229] .229 • Autonomous Research

Valuation Multiples Versus Peers
Deutsche Bank's current valuation multiples present a mixed picture when compared to European banking peers:

Price-to-Book Metrics : The bank trades at approximately 0.85x price-to-book value on 2025 estimates according to Metzler's analysis [230] . However, peer comparison data shows Deutsche Bank with a P/BV ratio of 0.67x and ROE of 8.7% , positioning it below the European peer median of 1.21x P/BV and 10.9% ROE [231] .230 • Auerbach Grayson 231 • Metzler Equity Research

Forward P/E Analysis : Autonomous Research's "look-through" P/E analysis shows Deutsche Bank trading at 9.8x two-year forward earnings, representing an 81% premium to the simple average of previous analytical notes [232] . This places Deutsche Bank in the "high, elevated multiple" category among European banks [233] .232 • Autonomous Research 233 • Metzler Capital Markets

Peer Positioning : The peer comparison reveals Deutsche Bank's ROE significantly lagging behind European banking peers, with major competitors like Banco Santander (12.6% ROE), BNP Paribas (10.3% ROE), and Commerzbank (10.8% ROE) all outperforming Deutsche Bank's 8.7% ROE [231] .231 • Metzler Equity Research

Valuation-Specific Factors
Several key factors influence Deutsche Bank's current valuation framework:

Return Adequacy Concerns : Metzler's analysis indicates that Deutsche Bank's forecasted ROE of approximately 9% for 2025-2027 does not cover the group's cost of equity , suggesting the current P/BV level of around 0.85x is "somewhat demanding" [234] . This ROE/COE gap represents a fundamental valuation challenge for the stock.234 • Auerbach Grayson

Historical Context : RBC notes that Deutsche Bank shares have re-rated recently and are now trading well above their historical average P/B ratio from 2013-2020 [235] . The firm suggests potential for further re-rating given scope for better cost control and higher ROTE ambitions, though this requires continued progress on profitability metrics.235 • RBC Capital Market Research

Sensitivity Analysis : Metzler's ROE/COE model sensitivity analysis demonstrates significant valuation sensitivity to changes in both cost of equity assumptions and long-term ROE projections [236] . The model shows price target ranges varying substantially based on different ROE and COE scenarios [237] .236 • Auerbach Grayson 237 • Metzler Capital Markets

Multiple Expansion Challenges : Despite improved consistency of performance leading to some rating upgrades, analysts remain cautious about Deutsche Bank's ability to sustain premium valuations without demonstrating that litigation and restructuring costs are truly in the past while maintaining revenue levels in a declining interest rate environment [238] .238 • HSBC Global Investment Research

Recent Developments
Deutsche Bank has undergone significant strategic and operational changes in 2025, positioning itself for the next phase of growth beyond its current transformation cycle. The bank's recent developments span leadership transitions, strategic partnerships, operational restructuring, and business portfolio optimization.

Strategic Partnerships and Growth Initiatives
A major strategic development was Deutsche Bank's participation in the "Made for Germany" initiative , launched with 61 leading German companies. The initiative represents a €631 billion investment pledge over three years , with over €100 billion in new commitments, conditional on policy and regulatory changes by the German government [93] [243] . This positions Deutsche Bank to capitalize on infrastructure and defense spending opportunities, particularly given its leading origination and advisory franchise in Germany [244] .93 244 • Transcript - Earnings Calls 243 • Jefferies Research

Deutsche Bank has also partnered with Google to accelerate AI opportunities [245] , demonstrating management's commitment to technology-driven transformation.

Operational Restructuring and Efficiency Measures
The bank continued its aggressive cost reduction program during 2024-2025. Deutsche Bank closed 125 branches in 2024 , bringing total closures to nearly 400 since 2021, while reducing full-time employees by 1,300 in 2024 alone [247] . The streamlining of retail brands , including the closure of the DSL brand, represents a significant simplification of the operating model [248] .247 • Transcript - Earnings Calls 248 • Transcript - Shareholder/Analyst Calls

These measures support Deutsche Bank's €2.5 billion operational efficiency program, with management indicating substantial progress toward completion [250] .249 • Jefferies 250 • INTRM

Business Portfolio Optimization
Deutsche Bank is actively reshaping its geographic footprint, notably putting its India retail banking business up for sale and inviting bids from domestic and foreign lenders [251] . This divestiture aligns with the bank's strategy to focus resources on higher-return markets and business lines.251 • Jefferies

Capital Allocation and Distribution Policy Updates
The bank updated its capital distribution policy to a 50% payout ratio , with plans to distribute additional excess capital above a 14% threshold [218] . RBC Capital Markets analysts expect "another €250m buyback in 2025 and €800m to be announced with FY 2025 results as part of the ordinary payout" [252] .218 252 • RBC Capital Market Research
